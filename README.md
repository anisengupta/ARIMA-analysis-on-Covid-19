We have performed some simple data visualisations and analysis using ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) to see if we can predict the number of cases of Covid-19 worldwide as well as in the UK. We appreciate that the statistical models we have produced are only simple and serve only to give a rough estimation and visualisations on the progress of Covid-19. We have used data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
